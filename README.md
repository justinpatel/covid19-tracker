# covid19-tracker
unofficial simple website

This is just for fun and learn how to work with API in Django framework.
I have used data from this API: https://api.covid19india.org/data.json

As of now, it shows the daily data of confirmed, deceased, recovered cases of the recent day.
In addition to that, total confirmed, deceased, recovered cases of all over India is also shown.

clone this repo using ```git clone https://github.com/justinpatel/covid19-tracker.git```
then ```cd covid19``` and go to cmd; run ```python manage.py runserver```
